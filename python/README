I'm starting a Python rewrite of the C++ code.

Partly because it's easier:
  - there is a native Python flag parsing library
  - Python comes integrated with sqlite3

I wrote the initial version in C++ for performance reasons, but am finding that
there are unforseen compilation issues with it.  Some architectures do not
support the realtime clock that I'm using.

Also, on most systems, calling Python once per command is not a terrible price
to pay.
