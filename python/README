This is a Python rewrite of the C++ code.

Partly because it's easier:
  - there is a native Python flag parsing library in 2.7+ (argparse)
  - Python comes integrated with sqlite3
  - Python comes with a logging library.

I wrote the initial version in C++ for performance reasons, but am finding that
there are unforseen compilation issues with it.  Some architectures do not
support the realtime clock that I'm using - there is a new version of the STL
library that segfaults when I try to use it.

Also, on most systems, calling Python once per command is not a terrible price
to pay.
